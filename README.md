 - This repository represents **"An in-depth analysis of current job opportunities in the corporate sector in India"**  
 - Lead by me, it was completed by a team of 04 members, over a span of 5 days.
 - The analysis has been done through aggregations on MySQL and Visualisation on PowerBI
 - With the help of this project we can get useful incites on the companies and industries hiring most aggressively, the best locations, and the skills most sought after by recruiters.

## ⏳ Dataset 
* Data of over 500 job openings was extracted from instahyre.com
* After performing data cleaning and modification on the raw data we were able to create 4 separate datasets namely jobs, companies, locations, and skills
* Download the datasets:
  https://github.com/dipeshbhatt1/Analysis-of-Corporate-Job-opportunities-in-India/tree/main/Datasets

## 🏽‍ Download Dashboard file:
- Download the PowerBI dashboard file: https://github.com/dipeshbhatt1/Price-Prediction-of-Pre-Owned-Cars/blob/main/Python%20Codes%20(in%20ipynb)/C-analysis-and-model.ipynb

    https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
3. Install Jupyter using command prompt:
```bash
    pip install jupyter
```
4. Install Python libraries viz. pandas, seaborn, selenium, time, one by one using the command prompt, for instance:
```bash
    pip install pandas
```
5. Once you have these all, launch the Jupyter Notebook using the command prompt:
```bash
    jupyter notebook
```
6. Install MySQL Workbench:
   https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
7. Install Microsoft PowerBI Desktop:

## <img src="Media Files/steps3.png" width="45" height="40"> Steps Involved

1. **Objective:** To perform an in-depth analysis on the current job opportunities in the corporate sector in India for the purpose of providing smart solutions to job seekers as well as consultancies
2. **Data Collection:** Data of 500 job-openings was scrapped through instahyre.com using selenium
3. **Data Modification and Organisation:** Initially the raw data had multiple locations in just one column, a similar situation was with skills too. This was because for a particular job opening the employer may provide more than one location option to candidates, and these days a single skill is not enough to enter a job in the corporate sector. So, two separate datasets for location and skills were created using the explode() function in pandas. After applying techniques like Data Cleaning (imputation, and removing duplicate records), EDA, and Feature Generation, a total of 4 datasets were generated, which were used to perform aggregations on MySQL and visualization was done on PowerBI by creating attractive dashboards. In the whole analysis the main features or details involves are mentioned below:
```bash
    designation
    job location
    industry hiring for
    desired skills
    desired experience
    name of the company (employer)
    establishment year of the company
    company size
    ratings for the company by employees on various factors
```
4. **Data Analysis and Visualisation:** All four datasets were imported on MySQL Workbench, created relations using primary key-foreign key combinations, and some inciteful aggregations were performed. Then the same datasets were also imported on PowerBI Desktop, relationships were created among each other, and then 3 different dashboards were created (refer to screenshots)
5. **Key Incites and Conclusions:** All the key incites and conclusions drawn are mentioned after the screenshots hereunder.

   1. Corporations or companies established more than 10 years ago are hiring more aggressively than startups
   2. Python and SQL still remain the most in-demand skills for Data Science and Analysis, followed by Machine Learning. Gone are those days when just having good knowledge of Excel was enough to aspire for the said field.
   3. Also, Python and Java are topping the list of most in-demand skills by recruiters in India
   4. Employees working with Startups have better overall experience than those working in Corporations
   5. We can see that some of the well-known companies, such as Delta, Uber, PhonePe, Jungless Games, Mahindra Insurance, etc, belonging to different company-size categories, are topping the list of overall ratings by their employees
   6. Bangalore is the topping the list, having the most number of job opportunities i.e. alomost 50%.
   7. Software Engineering is the highest recruiting industry, almost across all locations. Also, about 50% work from home job offers are given by the Software Engineering industry itself.
   8. Employees have marked better overall experience for companies with sizes 10-50 and 50-200 than all other categories which indicates that companies within these 2 categories may be better for candidates to look for.
   9. In the non-tech field - The sales and Business industry is recruiting the most
